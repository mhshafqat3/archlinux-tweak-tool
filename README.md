<h1 align="center">Compatibility</h1>


Originally designed and tested for ArcoLinux, ATT has broadened its scope to support other Arch-based systems. Here's a list of systems we aim to support:

| Distribution          | Website                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| ArcoLinux             | https://arcolinux.info        |

| BlackArch          | https://blackarch.org/        |


We face challenges not only in programming but also in understanding various distributions. As we gain expertise, we will continue to add support for more Arch-based systems.

## Unsupported Distros/Desktops

Currently, there are no specific distributions that ATT is incompatible with. We even have support for **Wayland (Hyprland/Sway, ...).**

## YouTube Playlist

We have an informative [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlloYVGq5pS5nvFc_LYRE82Gh3XWA6rVH) on YouTube that explains this project in detail.
